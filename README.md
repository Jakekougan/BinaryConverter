Binary Conversion Program

Author: Jake Kougan


Purpose: 
  
  While taking a computer organization and architecture class (aka CS256 for any of you IWU Titans out there). I found the process of converting values to and from binary on Homework assignments to be tedious.
  To circumvent this issue I wrote this quick Java program that does the heavy lifting for me, it was also a way to get some Java practice for my Algorithms class.

How to use:
  
  If you just want to use the compiled program, download the BinaryConverter.class file as it contains the compiled code.

  If you want to mess around with the source code download the BinaryConverter.java file.


Future Goals:
  
  Add a GUI for those who don't like using the command line.

HAPPY CONVERTING!!!
